# 🧭 Git Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the **Git Learning Roadmap** — a structured guide to help you learn Git progressively, from beginner basics to advanced power-user techniques.

## 🟢 Beginner Level

> Start here if you're new to Git. Learn how to set up a repo, make commits, check your work, and manage simple branches.

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| [git init](commands/1_Beginner/init.md) | Initialize a new repository |
| [git clone](commands/1_Beginner/clone.md) | Copy a repository to your local machine |
| [git add](commands/1_Beginner/add.md) | Stage changes for commit |
| [git commit](commands/1_Beginner/commit.md) | Save your staged changes |
| [git status](commands/1_Beginner/status.md) | Check your repository state |
| [git branch](commands/1_Beginner/branch.md) | Create and manage branches |
| [git checkout](commands/1_Beginner/checkout.md) | Switch branches or restore files |

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Level

> Learn how to collaborate with others, manage remote repositories, merge changes, and troubleshoot.

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| [git fetch](commands/2_Intermediate/fetch.md) | Get changes from remote without merging |
| [git pull](commands/2_Intermediate/pull.md) | Fetch and merge changes from remote |
| [git push](commands/2_Intermediate/push.md) | Upload local commits to remote |
| [git merge](commands/2_Intermediate/merge.md) | Combine changes from multiple branches |
| [git remote](commands/2_Intermediate/remote.md) | Manage remote connections |
| [git stash](commands/2_Intermediate/stash.md) | Temporarily save uncommitted changes |
| [git diff](commands/2_Intermediate/diff.md) | View differences between commits or files |
| [git log](commands/3_Advanced/log.md) | View detailed commit history |
| [git tag](commands/3_Advanced/tag.md) | Mark commits for releases |

---

## 🔵 Advanced Level

> For users who want to master Git. Learn history rewriting, tagging, commit recovery, and debugging techniques.

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| [git rebase](commands/3_Advanced/rebase.md) | Rewrite commit history cleanly |
| [git cherry-pick](commands/3_Advanced/cherry_pick.md) | Apply specific commits from another branch |
| [git reset](commands/3_Advanced/reset.md) | Undo commits or unstage files |

## 🚀 How to Learn Effectively

1. **Follow the order** — Each level builds upon the last.
2. **Practice commands** — Try examples from `.md` files in your own test repo.
3. **Experiment** — Create dummy branches, make merges, reset commits, and use stash.
4. **Move to Advanced** — Once you're confident with branching and merging, go deep with rebase, cherry-pick, and reflog.

---

## 💡 Recommended Learning Path

1. `init → add → commit → status → branch → checkout → clone`
2. `fetch → pull → push → merge → stash → diff`
3. `rebase → reset → revert → tag → log → reflog`

---

### 🧩 Pro Tip
Use `git --help <command>` or `git <command> -h` anytime for detailed CLI help.

Happy Learning! 🎓
