### Description:
> The `git pull` command is used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into your current branch. This command combines the actions of `git fetch` and `git merge` to update your local repository with changes from the remote repository. The `git pull` command is essential for keeping your local repository up to date with remote changes and integrating the latest updates into your current branch.

### Examples

1. Pull Changes from the Default Remote Repository

    `git pull`
   
    **Example:** `git pull`
    
    **Explanation:** This command fetches changes from the default remote repository (usually `origin`) and merges them into your current branch.

2. Pull Changes from a Specific Remote Repository

    `git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>`
   
    **Example:** `git pull origin main`
    
    **Explanation:** This command fetches changes from the `main` branch of the `origin` remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

3. Pull Changes from a Specific Remote Branch

    `git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>:<local-branch>`
   
    **Example:** `git pull origin feature1:local_branch`
    
    **Explanation:** This command fetches changes from the `feature1` branch of the `origin` remote repository and merges them into your local `local_branch` branch.

4. Pull with Rebase Instead of Merge

    `git pull --rebase`
   
    **Example:** `git pull --rebase`
    
    **Explanation:** This command fetches changes from the remote repository and rebases your local commits on top of the fetched changes instead of merging them. This can help to maintain a cleaner commit history.

5. Pull Changes from a Remote Repository and Discard Local Changes

    `git fetch <remote-name> <branch-name> && git reset --hard <remote-name>/<branch-name>`
   
    **Example:** `git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main`
    
    **Explanation:** This command fetches the latest changes from the `main` branch of the `origin` remote repository and then discards any local changes, aligning your local branch with the remote branch.

6. **Pull Changes from a Remote Repository Using SSH**

    `git pull ssh://<user>@<host>/<repo-path> <branch-name>`
   
    **Example:** `git pull ssh://github.com/user/repo.git main`
    
    **Explanation:** This command fetches changes from the `main` branch of the specified SSH repository and merges them into your current branch.
