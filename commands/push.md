### Description:
> The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. This command is typically used to share your commits with others and update the remote repository with your changes. It can push changes to specific branches or tags, and you can also push to multiple remote repositories if needed.

### Examples

1. Push Local Commits to the Default Remote Branch

    `git push`
   
    **Example**: `git push`
    
    **Explanation**: This command pushes commits from the current branch to the remote branch of the same name on the default remote repository (usually `origin`).

2. Push Local Commits to a Specific Remote Repository
    
    `git push <remote-name> <branch-name>`
   
    **Example:** `git push origin feature1`
    
    **Explanation:** This command pushes commits from the local `feature1` branch to the `main` branch on the `origin` remote repository.

3. Push Local Commits to a New Remote Branch

    `git push <remote-name> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>`
   
    **Example:** `git push origin feature1:new-feature`
    
    **Explanation:** This command pushes commits from the local `feature1` branch to a new branch named `new-feature` on the `origin` remote repository.

4. **Push All Local Branches to a Remote Repository**

    `git push --all <remote-name>`
   
    **Example:** `git push --all origin`
    
    **Explanation:** This command pushes all local branches to the specified remote repository (`origin` in this case).

6. Push a Tag to a Remote Repository

    `git push <remote-name> <tag-name>`
   
    **Example:** `git push origin v1.0`
    
    **Explanation:** This command pushes a specific tag (`v1.0`) to the remote repository.
